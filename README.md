# 📘 **NLP LAB PROGRAMS**

## **PROGRAM 1 — Text Preprocessing in NLP**

This program performs fundamental NLP preprocessing steps including:

- **Tokenization**
- **Filtration** (keeping only alphabetic tokens)
- **Script Validation** (ensuring tokens contain only A–Z)
- **Stop Word Removal**
- **Stemming** using PorterStemmer

It cleans raw input text and converts it into normalized, meaningful units for further NLP tasks.

## **PROGRAM 2 — N-Gram Modeling and Probability Distribution**

This program demonstrates:

- Construction of **unigram**, **bigram**, and **trigram** models
- Calculation of **probabilities** of given sentences
- Understanding how increasing the N-gram order affects context sensitivity

It helps analyze how language models predict the likelihood of word sequences.

## **PROGRAM 3 — Minimum Edit Distance (MED)**

Implements the **Levenshtein Distance** algorithm to compute the minimum number of operations:

- insertion
- deletion
- substitution

Used to convert one string into another. This program evaluates MED for various test cases, highlighting its role in spell checking, information retrieval, and computational linguistics.

## **PROGRAM 4 — Naive Bayes Text Classification**

Demonstrates the use of a **Naive Bayes classifier** with:

- Training data labeled as _comedy_ or _action_
- **Add-one (Laplace) smoothing**
- Calculation of posterior probabilities
- Prediction of the most likely class for a new document

This program shows how probabilistic models classify text.

## **PROGRAM 5 — Information Retrieval and Corpus Analysis**

Explores major text corpora and IR techniques:

- Study of **Brown, Inaugural, Reuters, and UDHR corpora**
- Creation of a **custom plaintext categorical corpus**
- Construction of **Conditional Frequency Distributions**
- POS tagging using **tagged_words** and **tagged_sents**
- Identification of **most frequent noun tags**
- Demonstration of **Rule-based Tagger** and **Unigram Tagger**

This program provides practical exposure to corpus structure and analysis.

---

## **PROGRAM 6 — Synonyms and Antonyms using WordNet**

Uses the WordNet lexical database to:

- Retrieve **synonyms** of a given word
- Retrieve **antonyms**, if available
- Demonstrate semantic relationships in lexical databases

WordNet is widely used in word-sense disambiguation and semantic similarity tasks.

---

## **PROGRAM 7 — Supervised Hidden Markov Model (HMM) POS Tagger**

This program:

- Trains a **supervised HMM** POS tagger using the **Brown corpus**
- Evaluates the accuracy of the model
- Tags custom user-input text

It demonstrates the use of probabilistic sequence models for part-of-speech tagging.
